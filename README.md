Needfinding Lab
Demographic (20+ of age):
Students (Fardeen) 
NYC citizens 
Elderly (Lubna)
Immigrants (Mehmet)
Faculty member (César) 

Identify (at least) three “types” of individuals:
Older people: Are more likely to be targeted by phishing emails because they don’t have as much experience with phishing.
Students: Are more desperate for jobs, and internships are more likely to click on emails that offer a good offer. Less likely to click on phishing emails because they’re more familiar with technology.
Recent Immigrants: More likely to be scammed based on immigration status, taxes, insurance, because they’re not familiar with U.S

 Sketch a plan:
 Lubna
Where: At work :) 
When: During the colleague’s lunch break
How: Analyzing their activities on the phone, and observing their actions. Interviewing them after observing, asking questions why they were frustrated, or confused. 
 César
Where: On campus.
When: Class hours.
How: In person interview.
Fardeen
Where: Online.
When: When the participant isn’t busy.
How: Voice or video call on discord.
Mehmet:
Where: At home
When: At 10 pm
How: In-person – analyze and ask questions

Conduct the contextual inquiry: (Report)
Lubna
The teacher, Ms.Fandacone (58) has agreed to be observed during her lunch break and be interviewed after I’m done observing her. She sits down at her desk to eat her lunch, and starts going through her phone. She’s watching videos on facebook, she gets interrupted with a call, she picks up and says “..Hello?” She sighs, and hangs up and continues to watch videos. She’s trying to find a good angle to place her phone and be able to eat, but I see her struggling. Once she finished eating, she went on her computer and started looking through her emails. While she scrolls through her email, she starts talking to another teacher about phishing emails. The teachers discuss how it’s harder to distinguish between phishing emails and legitimate emails, especially since they’re coming from “schools.nyc” emails. The teacher nods vigorously, “yes oh my god these emails are getting worse by the day”. The teacher goes back to replying to her emails, while her lunch break ends. 
Interview: 
I noticed you had a call during your lunch, but you hung up immediately? 
Yes,well it was a spam call. The person on the other end was speaking chinese. 
When you were trying  to adjust your phone, did  you wish there was something that could hold your phone and play your videos on a screen?
I don’t know about that, but I usually find a textbook to lean my phone on. It’s not that big a deal.
You mentioned you were getting scam/phishing emails? How do you know if they’re scam or not?
It’s becoming harder to tell, but some of them are pretty obvious. If they offer you money, I usually figure they’re phishing.
What is your plan of action when you suspect an email to be spam?
I used to click on the links, but now I immediately delete it and report it. However, there have been times when I’ve deleted legitimate emails, and couldn’t get those back.
That sounds horrible, how did you know that those emails were legitimate? 
The sender either reached out to me personally, or a colleague had a similar email. But by then it was too late to take back the report. Ever since, I’ve started to become hesitant to delete these emails, but I know it’s a good practice to delete them. 
How often do you get these phishing emails?
Too often honestly, if I had to give you a number, I’d say at least 14 a week now. And now they’re coming from fellow colleagues' emails, so it has become even more confusing. 
César
Every time the user sees a suspicious email they delete it.
One of the ways to detect possible spam emails is by looking at the address. If the user notices the address is not familiar, then that is a sign of possible spam.
Another way the user detects suspicious emails is by finding clues in the text of the email (ex. Job offers, unexpected rewards, etc.).

A friend & student, Jason Wood (20) agreed to share their screen and camera on Discord and consented to an interview afterward. 
Observation process:
Jason checks his discord group chats and servers for any new messages and pings and replies to them. 
He then gets on his phone to check Instagram. He browses through his feed and sends a message to a contact.
He then closes the app and opens TikTok, browsing his feed. He has a couple of laughs while browsing.
He then looks back at his desktop due to getting a notification in a group chat. He responds.
On his desktop, he opens Chrome and checks Gmail. He said he was okay sharing his emails with me.
On Gmail, he checks his emails and skips a couple of them. He clicks one, then quickly goes back to his email list.
He opens an email and actually thoroughly reads it this time.
He then gets on Outlook for any new emails. He clicks the first email and doesn’t speedread it.
He goes back to his email list on Outlook and skips a couple of emails, and lastly gets off. I thank him for his time.
Interview:
Me: “I noticed that you use both your desktop and your phone to check your social media platforms. Any reason for that?”
Jason: “Well, certain apps are meant to be viewed on certain devices. Apps like TikTok and Instagram are meant to be used on phones, while Discord is typically used on desktops.”
Me: “Do you get messages often? I’ve noticed that you checked both Discord and Instagram and replied to several messages.”
Jason: “Yeah. I get hundreds of messages daily”
Me: “What type of messages?”
Jason: “Mainly from relatives, friends, and people from my group projects.”
Me: “I’d like to shift my focus to your emailing platforms. Any reason as to why you used both Gmail and outlook rather than only one of them?”
Jason: “Yes. I mainly use Gmail to check for job offers and collaboration purposes. I use outlook to view school-related stuff.”
Me: “How often do you check your emails?”
Jason: “Once or twice a day.”
Me: “I also noticed that you tend to skip emails that you haven’t read. Any reason for that?”
Jason: “I’ve gotten some of the same emails before, so I already know what's going to be on it. I also skip emails that look suspicious. Sometimes I click it just to show that I read it.”
Me: “What do you mean by suspicious? Like spam emails?”
Jason: “Yes, also phishing emails. You know, those free money scams and fake relief funds.”
Me: “How often do you get said emails?”
Jason: “Often. Probably 3 or 4 times a week.”
Me: “How easily can you tell apart scam emails from legitimate ones?”
Jason: “Pretty easily.”
Me: “What do you do when you aren’t sure if a scam email is legitimate?”
Jason: “I click it. I check the subject, header, and footer of the email first. If it looks suspicious, I go back. If it doesn’t, I read it.”
Mehmet
The user does not check his email often.
His English level is low, even though he can communicate with others using basic English, he has a really low level of written/reading english.
He has a hard time identifying which email phishing/spam or not.
Even though he heard that he should not click on links on email, there have been times he has clicked on links and filled forms which let more phishing/spam emails.
Most emails he gets are about immigration and insurance.

5) Identify some core needs of your demographic and conduct task analysis using the questions below
  Needs we identified based on the contextual inquiry:
Checking if emails are spam, catching spam emails
Database that includes all the spam email addresses

Task Analysis

Who is going to use the system?
Our target audience will be students, faculty, and NYC citizens who use emails, and are victims of phishing and scams.
What tasks do they now perform?
They open their email, and read emails not knowing if the email is a scam or not. The doubt can lead to them opening their emails and being victims of phishing.
What tasks are desired?
To be able to check if the email is a scam or not, without having to doubt and clicking on potential phishing links. 
How are the tasks learned?
They accidentally click on a phishing link, and put in their personal information on a fake website. 
Where are the tasks performed?
On people’s phones, personal computers, tablets, etc.
What’s the relationship between customer & data?
Private. Customers don’t want their data to be taken away.
What other tools does the customer have?
Previous experience. Some users may be able to detect phishing emails simply by viewing the subject line.
How do users communicate with each other?
Users send emails to each other.
How often are the tasks performed?
This depends on a lot of factors such as demographics, activeness, and experience. Students would check their emails way more often than the elderly.
What are the time constraints on the tasks?
Depends on the email. Some emails require urgent action to be taken, while most do not.
What happens when things go wrong?
Data can be taken away and assets can be lost.

Questions to the users:
What do you do when you see a suspicious email?
How do you know the email is spam?

Analyze new and existing tasks that your application enables. Describe three to five tasks in moderate detail that users will perform with your top application idea.
Task 1: Searching the database for a scam email.
A responsive search bar will trim the database as you search an email.
Task 2: Adding an email to the database.
Clicking a “Report” page in the navigation bar will open a report page that will allow the user to add a scam email to the database.
Task 3: Clicking a database record to see comments
Example: Let's say someone clicks the 4th record in the database. They will be taken to a new page and can see the list of comments.
Task 4: Adding a comment to a scam email
User clicks on a record, inserts their name and comment, then presses submit.

Rosario



She’s 36 years old. She is a Spanish Professor at Brooklyn College. She has a family with two kids and a partner. She is teaching both online and in-person classes. She is very busy with her work and with taking care of her family. She is a little bit impatient but at the same time she doesn’t want to miss anything that is happening around her.
Because of her work and busy life, she is always connected and receives a lot of information through her email. She has a rule about emails, everything that could look slightly suspicious she deletes it. Because of that she started missing a lot of important notification both from her job and from her kids’ schools. She wants to find a way to be more sure about which emails to delete, because her current method is turning out to be counter-productive than useful.

Morris Wayland

58 years old, female, born in the U.S. 
Morris works at a school, and is planning to retire soon. She keeps getting emails about retirement funds, and insurance. Some of these emails are spam while some are legit. She’s tired of examining each email, and wants to find an easy way that can help her distinguish between which email is real and which is a phishing email.

Goal
Ivan Smirnoff

35 years old. Male, from Russia. Cashier at a bakery in Brooklyn. Makes 15$ per hour, works 60+ hours a week.
He loves music, plays some instruments when free.
Because of too much work, he has not found his love, and lives with 4 roommates. He loves Russian food and grocery which he uses NetCost for.
He is in the process of getting his immigration documents done and getting a green card. It has been 4 years he has been waiting.
He gets many phishing emails about immigration and wants to identify phishing/spam emails better.




Scenario#1: 
    Ivan has recently immigrated to the U.S, he has been volunteering at an elementary school near his home in order to practice his English without wasting money on lessons. One of the teachers enters the building, and seems frustrated at her phone. Ivan, knowing the feeling, walks up to her and asks, “Hey Morris, you look a bit worried there, is everything okay?” Morris replies, “Ivan, it’s been a while since I saw you around! My niece set up an email for me, but it has been a complete nightmare. I keep getting these emails about retirement funds, and I click on the little blue words, but I realize that they’re just scams!” Morris sighed frustrated. Ivan laughed, “Trust me Morris, you’re not the only one. Everytime I open my email I keep getting these emails about how my immigration has been processed. They ask me to click on a link to find out when I’ll get my green card. I’m so desperate I keep falling for it…” Morris looked shocked, “...how is this so common?” Ivan felt as frustrated as Morris looked, every day he got these emails and it was upsetting for him. If only there was a way to check if these emails were scams or not.

Scenario # 2:
    Sheyla is at college walking from one class to another. She’s trying to find the location of the new classroom. During the last class her Professor sent her an email with the location of the new classroom. Sheyla opens her smartphone to open the email app. Once again, she sees a long list of new emails that might or might not be legitimate. Scrolling down, and opening several emails, she finally finds what she wants. Coincidentally, Professor Rosario is walking down the hallway where Sheyla is. Sheyla apologies to her professor for running late to her class. She explains to her professor the situation with her email, and how difficult it can be to tell whether an email is authentic or not. Professor Rosario nods. She empathizes with Sheyla, Rosario has similar problems with her email accounts. Rosario tells her student how frustrating it could be to find out how many scams you can get from one’s email.



Design Process
Our website will lookup a locally created database of common phishing and scam emails. The user will be able to input an email to check if it’s a scam or not. They will also be able to contribute by adding suspicious emails to the database and sharing their stories related to the scam. The main purpose is to prevent people from getting phished. 
Main problem: The website is trying to solve the increasing rise of users falling for phishing and scam emails.

Problem(s):
Users cannot differentiate between legitimate and phishing/scam emails. Demographics affected: Students and people with less experience online, such as the elderly. Solution: The user will be able to input an email to check if it’s a scam or not.
Some users don’t know what to do when they see a phishing email. Demographics affected: Mainly the elderly, however, some phishing emails may not look suspicious at first. (So basically anyone) Solution: The website will have information about what users should and should not do when they get scam emails.

After interviewing people from our needfinding lab and hearing their stories about how they were scammed through their emails, we felt a personal connection because we have been in that position as well.
Therefore, we thought that it would be useful to have a website where everyone can easily find out if an email is a scam or not, and to be able to get help. That is why we think our website is an important project.



Storyboard

Storyboard (5 frames)
1st: Someone sitting on a computer
2nd: Person gets a scam email, is frustrated, and doesn’t know what to do
3rd: Friend of someone next to the person will inform the them about our website
4th: Person using the website and being happy because they are able to identify the email or not
5th: Person who is using the email is going to thank the other person saying that it is a life (or money!) saving website



What our site accomplished?
One task that will be accomplished via our website is to search the database of common scam/phishing emails. If they cannot find the email on the database, they can send us a ticket that contains the possible phishing email. The ticket will be sent to us and we will be able to identify if it is a scam or not.

Discussion on Design Choices: 
For the home-page we wanted to have a header where the user can search for the specific email. We had different ideas of how we wanted to portray the database, an idea was to have a table view where as someone else suggested to portray each email information on a card-like component. We ended up deciding that the table was a better option, it’s easier to read and navigate. It gives a cleaner look compared to the card, which looks a bit congested. Another issue was the need for the search button, since users can simply type and search for their email. However, we opted to add the search button, since it gives users a sense of control over their actions. 
For the email-more page, we had multiple ideas. Having the header was agreed universally for the sake of consistency. The placement of the comments, and adding additional comments was the issue, we had options to display the comments first, and then adding comments at the bottom. The second option was to report comments in one corner, and view comments in the other. This felt a bit fancy, but we didn’t think it was completely accessible for users, because the reporting block felt very limited. And since we were showing the comments twice, it felt redundant. The third option felt congested, even though it was neater than the second option. There was a lot going on in the page and could easily confuse the user. The first option felt the best for our interface, it was clean and gave enough space for the user to understand what was going on. 
The ticket page was a form, our main issues were the placement of the send button and if we’d like to center the longer input. After thorough discussion, having the send button in the center felt like the best option, considering that it would stand out to the user, and grab user attention. Having the input in the same formatting, and not centering it was the better option since it was consistent with the other input types. We favored consistency to accommodate our users.
We also decided to add audio and visual feedback, when they click on a submit button of a form they’ll receive a negative sound and an error if they don’t fill fields. And if they do, they’ll hear a positive note, and see a successful message at the bottom.
They can navigate easily throughout the website with the help of the menu on top in the header. Everytime they click on the search button, it’ll bring them to the homepage. 
The General Information page was mostly information, but we wanted to present in such a way that it didn’t overwhelm the users. We thought of using pictures, or simply having a question answer pattern. It still felt congested, and hard to comprehend, which is why we opted to use a drop down style q&a. The first option was the best choice, we had questions with an arrow, and the user can click on the question they’re most curious about and find the answers.

Patterns on User Behavior:

Write down the 3 patterns of user behavior that you think it is most important to support in your group website.

Lubna
Mehmet
Cesar
Fardeen
Satisficing
We want to make our website visually appealing and display relevant phishing email searches.
Spatial Memory
We want to follow the same conventions of other searching websites. This includes having a search page entirely dedicated to searching, and having familiar components placed in the correct spots. (Search bar being at the top, button being adjacent to it)
Response Time
We want our website to load search results and the other webpages fast.

Discussion:





User Evaluation:

Ask your partner to “scavenge” around the site to find the answers to your questions. Take note of any usability concerns/problems that you notice about the site. 
Fardeen
Evaluating Deeon St Jean from Group 7. (A person was absent from Group 1.)
Observations: 
The user doesn’t start off by using the search bar for task #1. Rather, he looks at the list first to find the email. 
For task #2, the user clicks on the record containing the email to view the scam type, rather than viewing the field on the table.
For task #3, since the table was already sorted by the number of reports, the user went to the second page to find the email with the least number of reports.
For task #4, the user clicks the record to view the comments, as expected.
Task #5 goes as expected, the user does not input a name & email but it still works as an anonymous user.
For task #6, the user goes to the table and goes to the record containing the email (rather than searching it), then clicks the email, then clicks the report button. However, he forgets the email so he has to go back. 
For task #7, the user goes to the email on the table rather than using the search bar, then clicks it to view the number of occurrences. 
Task #8 goes as expected, the user clicks on the FAQs link at the top and views a FAQ.
Task #9 goes as expected, the user searches an email on a different page.
Task #10 goes as expected, the user goes back to the home page.
Discussions on usability concerns: Page number on search page. The user did not know that there was more than 1 page until he scrolled down. He had no problem with the tasks.
What I personally learned and gained from this exercise:
Well, I learned that personas and scenarios from a lab that we’ve done earlier actually helped. Putting yourself in the user’s shoes beforehand definitely makes a website better.
That the smallest things can be improved. For example, we could improve the report page by adding placeholders.
Mehmet
Evaluating __Yixiong Cao___ from Group 1
Observations: 
Did not see the search field at first.
Liked the sound and toast appearing at the bottom when commenting
Had hard time understanding First Occurrence
Discussions on usability concerns:
Search field could be more visible
Did not know that there is a filter option on the table
What I personally learned and gained from this exercise
There is a learning curve with every website, the person who I interviewed did a lot better after the second time. It felt more natural.
As the designers and the coders of the website, we tend to think some functionality is visible enough however everyone is different and might not do what you want them to do.
It is best to make sure you the interviewee is calm and focused while doing the testing. Otherwise he/she might miss stuff.

What I personally learned and gained from this exercise
César
Evaluating Alexa from Group 1
Observations:
Task #1: The user immediately found the search bar. She was able to successfully find the given email.
Task #2: She was able to find the type of scam by looking at the top of the chart with the list of emails.
Task #3: By looking at the arrow in the “Number of reports” tab, she realized that the emails were easily sorted by number of reports. She clicked on it a couple of times until noticing that the smaller numbers were on top.
Task #4: She struggled to find the comments. At first, she thought there were none. Then she realized she could click on each row to get more information about each email.
Task #5: She successfully typed a new comment, and was able to find the “Add a comment” button.
Task #6: She struggled to find a way to report a new email. She quickly went back and forth from the “Comments” page to the “Home” page without finding a way to add a report. A moment later she spotted the light-gray tab on the upper-right corner that says “Report.”
Task #7: She successfully found the First Occurrence date of the given email in both the “Home” and “Comments” pages.
Task #8: She successfully found the FAQs.
Task #9: She was able to find another given email using the search bar in the FAQs page.
Tast #10: She successfully went back to the “Home” page.
Discussions on usability concerns:
Overall, it was a smooth and easy test. The user was able to complete all the given tasks. Only a couple tasks took her a little bit of extra time, but she still found the way to complete them.
One important feedback was to highlight the three options located on the upper-right corner of the page (Home, Report, and FAQs).
The “+ Report” button located at the “Comments” page didn’t seem too obvious. The user gave it a glance, but didn’t realize that the function of the button was reporting a new email instead of something related to the comment section. That button could be moved to the homepage or should have an explanatory introduction of what it does. It could be something like: “If you know any spam email that is not in our list YOU CAN ADD IT!”).
What I personally learned and gained from this exercise.
I learned that the user is the person that can give you the best feedback in terms of usability.
From the designer’s perspective, we can think our website is 100% intuitive, and that every button’s function seems clear. However, that is not always the case. I think it is important to define which functions should go in each page, and which ones can be global functions.

Usability problems found and suggested solutions:
Make the option buttons bigger and more visible.
Fix the “+ Report” button to only increase the number of reports instead of creating a new report for a new scam email.
Add time to the “First Occurrence” category in the table with the scam emails ex.: 05/09/2022.
Sorting according to “Type of Scam.”


New changes made:
1-The three option buttons were formatted to look more visible.
    Their font was increased, space added, and a hoover action was added (it shows the silhouette).

2-“+ Report” button.
This button used to be a link to the Report page, the action was changed to increase by one the Number of Reports. It can be clicked one time only, after that the button is disabled.

3-Fix the FAQs page scroll bar.

4-Add day and month for First Occurrence. Ex: 05/09/2022
The date field in the initial database was changed to the format mm/dd/yyyy. When a new scam email is added to the list of emails the date will be formatted in the same way.
 
5-The table should have no sorting at the beginning, only when the user clicks on a header, it should sort.
    Originally, the first time the home page was opened it would show the list of scam emails sorted by Number of Reports. Now, the list is presented unsorted.

6-Add option to sort by Email and Type of Scam
        The list of scam emails can now be sorted by Email and Type of Scam.
